-----------------------I-N-F-O-------------
When you run "./process.sh", this is what
it happens:

.Scripts in "./scripts" process raw-data
 in "./raw-data" into processed-data in 
 "./processed"

.Processed data is copied to ../results/data

--------------------U-S-A-G-E-------
1) run "bash process.sh"
2) results are in "./processed"
   and the comparing-with-AI folder
   ("../6-results") has its own copy
