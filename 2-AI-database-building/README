INSTRUCTIONS:      |
                   |
Option 1)          |
  don't do anything|
  here. Data here  |
  will be used by  |
  another script   |
                   |
Option 2)          |
"works-by-composer"|
must be unzipped.  |
All the composer's |
songs can be merged|
into one database  |
running "pipe.sh"  |
-------------------.


-------------m-o-r-e--i-n-f-o---------------------------------
Running "process.sh" will

(1): unzip the database in "../2-AI-database-building"

(2): extract sound samples from it

(3): make a TRAIN-VALIDATION-TEST database from it, using
     for "test" only 16*8=128 fragments: the same that 
     were used in the quiz.

(4): train 5 Neural Networks and 5 Random Forests classifiers
     from it and save their predictions over the testing data

(5): copy their predictions to "../6-results" so they can be 
     compared with humans predictions
