"Building the Quiz" means setting up an online
quiz that changes samples randomply.  

For that it is required to upload the 
APP/app.JS script to GoogleScipts API

   more info:
   For this you should create (A) a Google
   Spreadsheet and (B) a Google Forms. Their
   respective codes should be added to the 
   script. Finally upload the videos to (for
   example) YouTube and add their links in 
   the code. If a systematic extraction of
   a playlist-links is desired, as opposed
   to doing it manually, the script called
   "./extra/linksplaylist.py" could be used
   if you have a YoutubeV3API token. 
   If you dont, you should. It's free!
