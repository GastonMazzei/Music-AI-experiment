In this section, a comparison between 
humans and AI-based-classifiers is done
by means of comparing their Recall.


____W_H_A_T__I_S__R_E_C_A_L_L________
The Recall is defined as:
        -  .  -  .  -
PredictedTruePositives 
        / 
  TotalPositivesInTheDatabase

And it's mainstream interpretation 
is that it's a measure of how many 
positives you detected
