INSTRUCTIONS:

------what-does-it-do-???------
1) Processses the ".MIDI" files into ".CSV"
   and
2) Generates 128 videos so that an online 
   quiz can be built

------how-to-run-it-???--------
It should be run sequentially:
  1) unzip raw_data.zip
  2) run "python3 process1.py"
  3) run "bash process2.sh"


MORE:

.This is a CPU-intensive script. 

____________!!!!!________________
.If an online quiz isn't desired, 
 but the AI-based-classifiers are, 
 this sequential-directory can be 
 skipped because the AI-database
 is also compressed in 
  "../2-AI-database-building"
 under the name 
  "works-by-composer.zip"
