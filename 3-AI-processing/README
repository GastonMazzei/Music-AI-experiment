Running "process.sh" will

(1): unzip the database in "../2-AI-database-building"

(2): extract sound samples from it

(3): make a TRAIN-VALIDATION-TEST database from it, using
     for "test" only 16*8=128 fragments: the same that 
     were used in the quiz.

(4): train 5 Neural Networks and 5 Random Forests classifiers
     from it and save their predictions over the testing data

(5): copy their predictions to "../6-results" so they can be 
     compared with humans predictions
